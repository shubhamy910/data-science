    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attributes (features) at each level of the tree. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree Building: The algorithm starts with the entire dataset at the root node. It selects the feature that provides the best split, i.e., the feature that maximizes the separation between classes based on some criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or information gain).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node Splitting: The selected feature is used to split the data into subsets (child nodes) based on its values. This process continues recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stopping Criterion: The stopping criterion could be a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples in a node, or when a node is pure (contains only one class) or nearly pure based on a predefined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction: To make predictions, new data is passed through the tree by following the path of feature comparisons. It eventually reaches a leaf node, which represents the predicted class for the input data."

    "Decision tree classification is based on minimizing impurity or maximizing information gain. For example, Gini impurity measures the impurity or disorder of a dataset. Here's the intuition:\n",

    "- Gini Impurity: Calculate the Gini impurity for a node: Gini(D)=1−∑i=1toC(pi)^2. where C is the number of classes, and pi is the probability of an instance belonging to class i in the node.\n",
    "- Information Gain: The idea is to select the feature that minimizes Gini impurity or maximizes information gain when splitting a node. Information gain measures how much the feature reduces impurity in the child nodes:Information Gain(D,A)=Gini(D)−∑v∈Values (A)∣Dv∣/∣D∣ * Gini(Dv). where D is the current dataset, A is the feature being considered, Values(A) are its possible values, Dv is the subset of data when A takes value v.\n",
