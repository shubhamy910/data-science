    "- Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "- Unlike OLS, Ridge Regression adds a regularization term to the loss function, which is the sum of squared coefficients (L2 regularization). This regularization term encourages the model to have smaller coefficient values.\n",
    "- The key difference is that Ridge Regression introduces a tuning parameter (lambda or α) that controls the strength of regularization. A higher lambda value results in stronger regularization and smaller coefficient values.\n"
