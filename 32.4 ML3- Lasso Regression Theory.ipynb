    "- Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term to the loss function, which is the sum of the absolute values of coefficients (L1 regularization).\n",

    "- Unlike Ridge, which uses L2 regularization, Lasso tends to create sparse models with a subset of important features retained"
