    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data instead of generalizing to unseen data. As a result, the model performs excellently on the training data but fails to perform well on new, unseen data (test data). Consequences include poor generalization, reduced model performance on real-world data, and increased sensitivity to noise.\n",

    "Mitigation: To reduce overfitting, you can use techniques like cross-validation, early stopping during training, reducing model complexity, or employing regularization methods.\n",

    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's cost function. The penalty discourages the model from relying too much on certain features or being overly complex.\n",

    "Common regularization techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): Adds the absolute value of the coefficients as a penalty term to the cost function. It promotes sparsity in the model, forcing some feature weights to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): Adds the squared value of the coefficients as a penalty term to the cost function. It forces the model to distribute the weights more evenly across features, reducing the impact of any single feature.\n",

    "Elastic Net Regularization: A combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which balances the strengths of both techniques to produce a more flexible regularization approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization helps control the model's complexity by penalizing large parameter values, leading to a more generalized model that can better handle unseen data. By tuning the regularization strength, you can find the right balance between bias and variance, improving the model's overall performance."
