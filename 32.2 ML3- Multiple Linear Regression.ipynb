    "- R-squared is a statistical metric that measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) that is explained by the independent variables (X) in a linear regression model.\n",
    "- It is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance and typically ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "- The formula for R-squared is: R-squared = 1 - (SSE / SST), where SSE is the sum of squared residuals and SST is the total sum of squares.\n",
    "- -squared represents the goodness of fit of the model; a higher R-squared indicates a better fit. It ranges from 0% (no variance explained) to 100% (all variance explained)."
