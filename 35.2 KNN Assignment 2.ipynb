    "Answer1. The main difference between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance lies in how they measure distance between points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Euclidean Distance: It measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It considers both the horizontal and vertical distances.\n",
    "- Manhattan Distance: It measures the distance as the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points. It only considers horizontal and vertical movements, akin to navigating a city grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect KNN's performance because it determines how \"closeness\" between data points is defined. Euclidean distance tends to work well when features are continuous and measured in the same units. Manhattan distance can be more appropriate when features are not naturally represented in Euclidean space or when you want to emphasize differences along individual dimensions. The choice should be based on the nature of your data.\n",
