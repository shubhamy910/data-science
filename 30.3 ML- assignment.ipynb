    "Answer1. The filter method in feature selection is a technique used to select relevant features from a dataset before applying a machine learning algorithm. It works by evaluating and ranking individual features based on some statistical measure or criterion, without considering the machine learning model to be used. Common scoring methods include correlation, chi-squared test, information gain, ANOVA F-value, and mutual information. Features are then selected based on a threshold, and irrelevant or redundant features are discarded."

    "Answer2. The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets using a specific machine learning model. It searches for the best subset of features by training and testing the model on various combinations of features. The Wrapper method includes techniques like forward selection, backward elimination, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and exhaustive search. Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method considers the interaction and dependencies between features but is computationally more intensive."

    "Answer3. Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection into the process of training a machine learning model. Some common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 Regularization (Lasso): It adds a penalty term to the model's cost function based on the absolute values of feature coefficients. L1 regularization encourages sparsity in feature selection, effectively eliminating irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree-based algorithms: Decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting can evaluate feature importance during training. Features with low importance can be pruned or eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): It's a wrapper method but is sometimes considered embedded when used with certain algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or linear regression. RFE recursively removes the least important features until the desired number is reached.\n",

    "4. Feature selection through feature importance: Some algorithms provide a direct measure of feature importance, such as feature_importances_ in scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier or coef_ in linear models."
