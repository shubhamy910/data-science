To use extrinsic measures for evaluation, you typically follow these steps:\n",

    "- Performance Metrics: Define appropriate performance metrics for the specific task. For example, accuracy, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, etc., depending on the nature of the task.\n",

    "- Use Cases: Intrinsic measures are often used during model development, training, or fine-tuning to gain insights into the model's behavior, characteristics, and limitations.

    "\n",
    "- Intrinsic measures include perplexity, word embeddings quality, etc., while extrinsic measures include accuracy, F1 score, BLEU score, etc.\n",

    "Using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has some limitations, and it may not provide a complete picture of a model's performance, especially in situations where class distribution is imbalanced or when certain types of errors are more critical than others. Here are some common limitations of accuracy and ways to address them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imbalanced Class Distribution:\n",
    "- Limitation: Accuracy can be misleading when there is a significant class imbalance. In imbalanced datasets, a model that predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy while providing little practical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Consider using alternative metrics that are less sensitive to class imbalances, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unequal Importance of Classes:\n",
    "- Limitation: In some classification tasks, the classes may have unequal importance. Misclassifying instances from one class might have more severe consequences than misclassifying instances from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Assign different costs or weights to misclassifications based on the importance of each class. This can be done by modifying the loss function used during training or by using metrics like weighted F1-score or weighted precision-recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Type I and Type II Errors:\n",
    "- Limitation: Accuracy treats false positives and false negatives equally, even though their impact on a problem may differ. In some cases, one type of error may be more critical or costly than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Depending on the problem, emphasize either precision or recall. Use precision when minimizing false positives is crucial, and use recall when minimizing false negatives is more important. Adjust the classification threshold accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probabilistic Outputs:\n",
    "- Limitation: Some models provide probabilistic outputs, where instances are assigned probabilities of belonging to each class. Accuracy cannot make use of these probabilities and only considers the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Use probabilistic evaluation metrics like log loss (cross-entropy), Brier score, or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) to assess the quality of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiclass Classification:\n",
    "- Limitation: Accuracy is straightforward to interpret in binary classification but may not be as intuitive for multiclass problems. It does not consider the complexities of correctly predicting multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Utilize metrics tailored to multiclass problems, such as macro and micro averages of precision, recall, and F1-score, or confusion matrices for more detailed insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Probabilistic Outputs:\n",
    "- Limitation: Some models provide probabilistic outputs, where instances are assigned probabilities of belonging to each class. Accuracy cannot make use of these probabilities and only considers the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: Use probabilistic evaluation metrics like log loss (cross-entropy), Brier score, or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) to assess the quality of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Changing Decision Thresholds:\n",
    "- Limitation: Accuracy is insensitive to changes in decision thresholds. A model may produce different classification results by adjusting the threshold, leading to different accuracy values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing: If applicable, evaluate the model's performance over a range of decision thresholds and consider metrics like the ROC curve or precision-recall curve to make informed threshold choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while accuracy is a useful metric for classification tasks, it should not be used in isolation. Depending on the nature of the problem and the specific goals, it's important to choose or combine evaluation metrics that provide a more comprehensive assessment of a model's performance, taking into account class distribution, the relative importance of classes, and the types of errors that matter most in the given context."
