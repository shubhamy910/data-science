    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. In data science, this process is essential because most machine learning algorithms work with numerical data, and categorical data, which consists of labels or categories, cannot be directly used as input. Data encoding helps in making the data suitable for analysis and modeling."

    "Nominal encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into numerical values by assigning a unique integer to each category. It does not imply any order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, if you have a \"Color\" feature with categories like \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green,\" you can use nominal encoding to represent them as 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This encoding is suitable for data where there is no inherent order among the categories.\n",

    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when there are a large number of unique categories in a categorical feature. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, which can lead to a high-dimensional dataset, making it inefficient and potentially causing issues like the curse of dimensionality.\n",

Using one-hot encoding in this case would create hundreds of binary columns, making the dataset unwieldy. Instead, nominal encoding can be applied to assign a unique integer code to each cuisine type, reducing the dimensionality while preserving essential information."
