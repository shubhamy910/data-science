    "a) Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of AI is a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa. These virtual assistants can understand voice commands, answer questions, perform tasks like setting reminders, and even engage in natural language conversations with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience or training on data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An email spam filter is an example of machine learning. The filter \"learns\" from past examples of spam and non-spam emails to predict and filter out future spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning: Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process and learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms attempt to simulate the workings of the human brain to recognize patterns and features in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition systems, such as those used in self-driving cars or facial recognition applications, often rely on deep learning techniques to identify objects and faces accurately."
