    "\n",
    "#2- Concurrency: In multiprocessing, processes can execute independently and concurrently, making use of multiple processor cores. In multithreading, threads run concurrently within a single process, sharing the CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3- Memory and data sharing: Processes in multiprocessing have separate memory spaces, and communication between them requires explicit inter-process communication mechanisms like pipes or queues. In multithreading, threads share the same memory space, making it easier to share data between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4- Performance: Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks, as it can fully utilize multiple processor cores, resulting in improved performance. Multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks, as threads can overlap I/O operations while waiting for data, thus maximizing CPU utilization.\n",
