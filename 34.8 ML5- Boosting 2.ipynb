    "Answer1. Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that builds a predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple weak learners, typically decision trees. The \"gradient\" in Gradient Boosting refers to the optimization process used to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. Gradient Boosting iteratively improves the model by training new weak learners that focus on the errors made by the previous ones. It is a powerful technique known for its high predictive accuracy."

    "Answer4. In Gradient Boosting, a weak learner is a simple, base model that performs slightly better than random guessing on a given task. Typically, decision trees with limited depth (shallow trees) are used as weak learners. Weak learners are often referred to as \"base learners\" because they serve as the building blocks for the ensemble. In each boosting iteration, a weak learner is trained to predict the errors (residuals) made by the ensemble of previously trained weak learners. The idea is that by combining the predictions of many weak learners, the ensemble can learn complex relationships in the data."

    "Answer5. The intuition behind Gradient Boosting is to sequentially train a series of weak learners, each one focusing on the errors made by the previous learners. This approach is analogous to a \"team of experts\" where each expert specializes in correcting specific mistakes made by the team. By combining the expertise of these experts (weak learners), the ensemble becomes a strong learner capable of accurate predictions. Gradient Boosting optimizes the model by minimizing the gradient of a loss function, effectively moving the predictions closer to the target values in each iteration."
