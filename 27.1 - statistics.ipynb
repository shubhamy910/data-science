    "Descriptive Statistics-: Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphs like histograms and box plots. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the average income of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics-: Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. For instance, inferential statistics can be used to determine whether a new drug is effective by comparing the results of a control group and a treatment group."

For example, if a variable is measured at the ordinal level, it would be inappropriate to calculate a mean, but a median would be a suitable measure of central tendency."

    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It focuses on organizing, presenting, and analyzing data to provide a meaningful summary. Descriptive statistics are used to describe the characteristics of a sample or population. Examples of descriptive statistics include calculating the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, or creating graphs like histograms or pie charts. Descriptive statistics are used to provide insights and understand patterns within the data.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions or making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory and statistical methods to make generalizations or predictions. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses, estimate population parameters, and determine the significance of relationships or differences. For example, conducting hypothesis tests or constructing confidence intervals are inferential statistical techniques."
