    "- Grid search CV, short for Grid Search Cross-Validation, is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model.\n",
    "- It works by specifying a grid of hyperparameter values to explore. For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, the model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation. Cross-validation helps assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "- The combination of hyperparameters that yields the best cross-validation performance (e.g., highest accuracy or lowest error) is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model.\n"

    "- Grid Search CV systematically explores all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a predefined grid, making it exhaustive but potentially computationally expensive.\n",

    "- Choose Grid Search when you have a relatively small set of hyperparameters to explore, and you want to be thorough. Choose Random Search when you have limited computational resources or a large hyperparameter search space and want to explore a broader range of values efficiently.\n"
