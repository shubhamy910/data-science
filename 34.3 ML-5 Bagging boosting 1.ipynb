    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines predictions from multiple base models (learners) to improve the overall predictive performance. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble techniques aim to harness the collective intelligence of multiple models to make more accurate predictions.\n"

    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can reduce overfitting: Combining multiple models helps reduce the risk of overfitting, leading to more generalizable and reliable predictions.\n",
    "- Improved predictive accuracy: Ensembles often outperform individual models by capturing different aspects of the data and reducing bias.\n",
    "- Increased robustness: Ensembles are less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data, making them more reliable in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "- Better handling of complex relationships: They can capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data that individual models may struggle to model.\n"

    "Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in which multiple copies of a base model (often a decision tree) are trained on different random subsets of the training data (bootstrap samples). These models are then combined by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) to make predictions. Bagging helps reduce variance and improve model stability.\n"
